This directory is where the styling for each deGov module is placed within a directory which is named like the module (excepting the `degov_` prefix and the `_element` suffix for paragraphs â€“ paragraph modules are instead prefixed with `paragraph_`)

Within each module styling directory there can be one or several of the following files:
- `_fields.scss`
- `_views.scss`
- `_blocks.scss`
- `_pages.scss`
- `_paragraphs.scss`
- `_styles.scss` (only to be used if the above do not fit)
